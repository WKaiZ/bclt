    Traverse the directory tree starting at 'folder_path' to identify and collect filenames matching specific patterns.

    - Appends filenames matching the pattern 'FDA-YYYY-P-NNNN-0001' (citizen petitions) to the 'citizens' list.
    - Tracks the most recent file matching 'from_FDA' and, upon encountering a file with a differing prefix, appends the previous 'from_FDA' file (ensuring that it is the final response from FDA) to the 'responses' list.
    - Ensures the last tracked 'from_FDA' file is added to 'responses' after traversal.

"""
Processes a list of citizen petition files and response files by automating interactions with a GUI to extract data 
from each file and save the results into corresponding Excel spreadsheets.

Steps:
1. Retrieves file names for citizen petitions and responses using `get_file_names`.
2. Iterates through the list of citizen petition files:
   - Simulates GUI interactions to upload the file and submit a prompt.
   - Waits for the process to complete or detects errors.
   - Extracts the response data, parses it, and saves it into the 'outputs_citizens.xlsx' spreadsheet.
3. Repeats the same process for response files, saving the results into the 'outputs_responses.xlsx' spreadsheet.

Parameters:
- folder (str): The folder containing the files to process.
- citizens (list): List of citizen petition file names.
- responses (list): List of response file names.

Note:
- Relies on GUI automation using `pyautogui` and clipboard operations with `pyperclip`.
- Requires Excel files ('outputs_citizens.xlsx' and 'outputs_responses.xlsx') with a sheet named '2024'.
